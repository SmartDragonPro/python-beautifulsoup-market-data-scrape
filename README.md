# STOCK MARKET DATA ANALYSIS
### Use Python to build a webscraper and get data for S&P 500 tickers and industry. Join with financial data from Yahoo Finance (or another financial data) API. Use data manipulation and visualization for financial and investment analysis such as comparing rates of return, calculating risk, building trading algorithms, and making investment decisions.  
### First, this project will start with technical analysis, measuring stock price data for movement (volatility) and volume.
### Second, I plan to include a branch with fundamental analysis, to look more in depth at financial statement analysis.
### Third, I am interested in expanding the analysis to include Python for cryptocurrencies, such as financial and investment analysis for ICOs, and predicting crypto prices. 
#### DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial adviser nor a CPA. This project is for educational purposes only. Investing of any kind involves risk. Although it is possible to minimize risk, your investments are solely your responsibility. It is very important to conduct your own research. I am merely sharing my project with not guarantee of either gains or losses on any investments.

### You will need to know how to install Python packages and modules with pip

## Packages required for this project:
### pandas
### pandas-datareader
### beautifulsoup4
### scikit-learn
### * Dependencies & modules you might have to install: NumPy, Matplotlib, mplfinance, yahoo (or another finance API) 

### Use Pandas/NumPy, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
### Scrape stock tickers from web (i.e. Wikipedia) 
### For this project, the SP500 list is from: "List of S&P 500 Companies" at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies
### Use Requests to scrape data for Beautiful Soup to parse
### Using this soup object, navigate/search HTML for data you want to pull.
