# STOCK MARKET DATA ANALYSIS
### Use Python to scrape data and join with financial data from Yahoo Finance (or another finance) API. Use data manipulation and visualization for financial and investment analysis (i.e. compare rates of return, calculate risk, build trading algorithms, and make investment decisions).  
#### First, this project will start with technical analysis, measuring stock price data for movement (volatility) and volume.
#### Second, I plan to include a branch with fundamental analysis, to look more in depth at financial statement analysis.
#### Third, I am interested in expanding the analysis to include Python for cryptocurrencies, such as financial and investment analysis for ICOs, and predicting crypto prices. 
##### <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> I am not a financial adviser nor a CPA. This project is for educational purposes only. Investing of any kind involves risk. Although it is possible to minimize risk, your investments are solely your responsibility. It is very important to conduct your own research. I am merely sharing my project with not guarantee of either gains or losses on any investments.

# <b> Requirements & Overview:</b> 
## Build a webscraper to get data for S&P500 List</b>
## Use Yahoo Finance (or other) API for financial data
## Use Pandas to join stock tickers with financial data
## Analyze data with various quantitative models to calculate risk and make investment decisions.
###   - Download data as csv and read. 
###   - Build quantitative models to predict returns & evaluate risk. 
###   - Run basic Value at Risk (VaR) calculations, Monte Carlo Simulations
###   - Looking at news sentiment as a proxy for market volatility.
###   - Graph/visualize data.

#### <b> NOTE:</b> If you are new to Python, check out the Python Programming Fundamentals website for tutorials at https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-learn-python-3-tutorials/using. You will need to review up to installing Python packages and modules with pip. 

## <b>Packages required for this project:</b>
### pandas
### pandas-datareader
### beautifulsoup4
### scikit-learn
#### * Dependencies & modules you might have to install: NumPy, Matplotlib, mplfinance, yahoo (or another finance API) 

### <b> Use Pandas/NumPy, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.</b>
### Scrape stock tickers from web (i.e. Wikipedia) 
### For this project, the SP500 list is from: "List of S&P 500 Companies" at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies
### Use Requests to scrape data for Beautiful Soup to parse
### Using this soup object, navigate/search HTML for data you want to pull.
